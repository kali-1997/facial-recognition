Title: Face Recognition System using PCA with ANN Algorithm

To build a face recognition system, we'll use the PCA with ANN approach. I found a dataset of face images on this GitHub link: dataset.zip. I plan to design this system using Python, and I'm allowed to use libraries like NumPy and OpenCV.

Training Steps:

Creating Face Database: I'll turn each face image into a matrix and create a big database with them.
Calculating Mean: By summing up all face matrices and dividing by the number of faces, I'll find the average face.
Mean Zeroing: To center the faces around zero, I'll subtract the mean face from each face image.
Computing Covariance: I'll measure how faces vary together using surrogate covariance for easier computation.
Eigenvalue Decomposition: Breaking down the covariance matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
Selecting Feature Vectors: Choosing the most important directions where faces vary the most, these are our feature vectors.
Generating Eigenfaces: Projecting each mean-centered face onto these feature vectors to create eigenfaces.
Creating Face Signatures: Projecting each mean-centered face onto eigenfaces to create unique face signatures.
Training ANN: Using these signatures to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for recognition.
Testing Steps:

Preparing Test Image: I'll take a new face image and convert it into a column vector.
Mean Zeroing: Subtracting the mean face from the test image to center it.
Projecting onto Eigenfaces: I'll project the mean-centered test image onto the eigenfaces.
Using ANN for Prediction: Utilizing the trained ANN to predict the identity of the face.
Evaluation:

Changing k Value: I'll vary the number of selected eigenvectors (k) to see how it affects classification accuracy and plot a graph for comparison.
Imposter Test: I'll introduce faces not in the training set and check if the system correctly identifies them as not enrolled.
By following these steps, I aim to create an accurate face recognition system using PCA with ANN.
